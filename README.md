# Ebay Oauth Client

Allows developers to fetch an OAuth token that can be used to call the eBay Developer REST APIs using PHP.

## What is OAuth
OAuth 2.0 is the most widely used standard for authentication and authorization for API based access. The complete end to end documentation on how eBay OAuth functions may be used is available at developer.ebay.com. 
See: https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-tokens.html

## Installation

Include in your project via composer: 
```bash
$ composer require dvicklund/ebay-oauth-php-client
```

## Usage

##### EbayAuthToken(config)
Create a new instance of `EbayAuthToken` with a relevant config.
```php
use EbayOauthToken\EbayOauthToken;

$ebayAuthToken = new EbayOauthToken([
    'env' => '<SANDBOX|PRODUCTION>', // If not provided, env defaults to PRODUCTION
    'clientId' => '<your_client_id>',
    'clientSecret' => '<your_client_secret>',
    'redirectUri' => '<redirect uri>'
]);
```

##### $ebayAuthToken->getApplicationToken(environment)
Generate client credential token.
```php
$token = $ebayAuthToken->getApplicationToken('PRODUCTION');
print($token);
```

##### $ebayAuthToken->generateUserAuthorizationUrl(environment, scopes[, options])
Generate user consent authorization url.
```php
$authUrl = $ebayAuthToken->generateUserAuthorizationUrl('PRODUCTION', $scopes);
print($authUrl);
```

You can also provide optional values:\
**state:** An opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback.\
**prompt:** Force a user to log in when you redirect them to the Grant Application Access page, even if they already have an existing user session.

The method call above could also be done as
```php
$options = [ 'state' => 'custom-state-value', 'prompt' => 'login' ];
$authUrl = $ebayAuthToken->generateUserAuthorizationUrl('PRODUCTION', $scopes, $options);
print($authUrl);
```

##### $ebayAuthToken->exchangeCodeForAccessToken(environment, code)
Get a User access token.
```php
$accessToken = $ebayAuthToken->exchangeCodeForAccessToken('PRODUCTION', $code);
print($accessToken);
```

##### $ebayAuthToken->getAccessToken(environment, refreshToken, scopes)
Use a refresh token to update a User access token (Updating the expired access token).
```php
$accessToken = $ebayAuthToken->getAccessToken('PRODUCTION', $refreshToken, $scopes);
print($accessToken);
```

## Library Setup and getting started

1. Invoke the oauth ebay library as given below
```php
use EbayOauthToken\EbayOauthToken;

$ebayAuthToken = new EbayOauthToken([
    'filePath' => 'demo/eBayJson.json' // input file path.
]);
```
OR
```php
$ebayAuthToken = new EbayOauthToken([
    'clientId' => '<your_client_id>',
    'clientSecret' => '<your_client_secret>',
    'redirectUri' => '<redirect_uri_name>'
]);
```
2. If you want to get your application credentials such as AppId, DevId, and CertId. Refer to [Creating eBay Developer Account](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/creating-edp-account.html) for details on how to get these credentials.
3. You can refer to Example.php for an example of how to use credentials.
4. For Authorization code grant
    1. Get user consent url using ```$ebayAuthToken->generateUserAuthorizationUrl()```
    2. Open the generateUserAuthorizationUrl in the browser, which allows you to login in to ebay site. You will get an authorization code.
    3. Pass the authorization code retrieved in the above step to exchangeCodeForAccessToken method using ```$ebayAuthToken->exchangeCodeForAccessToken($environment, $code)```

## Configure credentials
Create a config JSON file in your application. The config file should contain your eBay applications keys: App Id, Cert Id & Dev Id. A sample config file is available at demo/ebay-config-sample.json. You could also set these parameters in a .env file, and pass them into the `$options` object during setup.

```json
{
    "SANDBOX": {
        "clientId": "---Client Id---",
        "clientSecret": "--- client secret---",
        "devid": "-- dev id ---",
        "redirectUri": "-- redirect uri ---",
        "baseUrl": "api.sandbox.ebay.com" //don't change these values
    },
    "PRODUCTION": {
        "clientId": "---Client Id---",
        "clientSecret": "--- client secret---",
        "devid": "-- dev id ---",
        "redirectUri": "-- redirect uri ---",
        "baseUrl": "api.ebay.com" //don't change these values
    }
}
```

## Types of Tokens
There are two types of tokens you will need to use.

### Application Token
An application token contains an application identity which is generated using client_credentials grant type. These application tokens are useful for interaction with application specific APIs such as usage statistics, etc.
### User Token
A user token (access token or refresh token) contains a user identity and the applicationâ€™s identity. This is usually generated using the authorization_code grant type or the refresh_token grant type.

## Supported Grant Types for OAuth
All of the regular OAuth 2.0 specifications such as client_credentials, authorization_code, and refresh_token are supported. [Refer to eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-tokens.html)

### Client Credentials
This grant type can be performed by simply using ```$ebayAuthToken->getApplicationToken()```. Read more about this grant type at [oauth-client-credentials-grant](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-client-credentials-grant.html).

### Authorization Code

This grant type can be performed by a two step process. Call ```$ebayAuthToken->generateUserAuthorizationUrl($environment, $scopes, $state)``` to get the Authorization URL to redirect the user to. Once the user authenticates and approves the consent, the callback needs to be captured by the redirect URL setup by the app and then call ```$ebayAuthToken->exchangeCodeForAccessToken($environment, $code)``` to get the refresh and access tokens.

Read more about this grant type at [oauth-authorization-code-grant](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-authorization-code-grant.html).

### Refresh Token

This grant type can be performed by simply using ```$ebayAuthToken->getAccessToken($environment, $refreshToken, $scopes)```. Usually access tokens are short lived and if the access token is expired, the caller can use the refresh token to generate a new access token. Read more about it at [Using a refresh token to update a user access token](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-auth-code-grant-request.html)
